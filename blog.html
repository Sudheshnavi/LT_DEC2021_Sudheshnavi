                Youâ€™re having the time of your life, but also probably moving away from home for the first time,

                <br>
                <p>The institute attracts the cream of student community from across the country through national level 
                    competitive examinations and interviews It believes that the true potential of such students cannot 
                    be realized through academics alone. The students are provided with opportunities for exploring and 
                    enhancing their talents in extra-curricular activities through Literary, Cultural and Sports clubs. 
                    This helps to promote self management skills and core values in the students, 
                    all of which cumulatively help to groom the students into integrated personalities</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The students are involved in a host of other activities. 
                        All major events like youth festivals: technical competitions are actively organized and conducted by 
                        the student body. There is student representation on various administrative committees like Hostel 
                        Governing Body. Canteen Committee, Course Monitoring, Discipline Committee etc.
                         All Student committees function under the peripheral supervision of faculty. 
                         Students thus get an opportunity to shoulder responsibility and understand better the issues, 
                         challenges and compulsions that are part and parcel of the day-to-day administration of an 
                         organization, 
                        which indirectly provides for rich experiential learning in the Science of Management.</p>
