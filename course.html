        <h3>Intermediate</h3>
        <p>With the end of your school life, a new chapter of your life will begin.
            At this point, you must make some critical decisions.
             You might have to find a career that triggers your passion for a 
             clear path from your school life to your professional life. 
             In this situation, if you lack knowledge or are unable to choose your 
             passionate career, you may end up in a fix or confused about your next course of action.
           Furthermore, this is the only time most students make poor decisions 
           after being swayed by relatives or through misinformation. 
           Every individual has a unique set of skills, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>

    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Degree</h3>
        <p>Earning a college degree is a great way to improve your job prospects.
            In fact, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that an advanced level of 
            education can lead to higher wages and lowered unemployment rates. 
            Depending on your career aspirations, you can choose from different degrees programs.
           They are <br>Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS)<br>
           (BFA) Bachelor of Fine Arts<br>
           Bachelor of Science (B.S.)<br>

    </div>
    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
        <p>Postgraduate education involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, 
            academic or professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other 
            qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, 
            and it is normally considered to be part of higher education. 
            In North America, this level is typically referred to as graduate school.
            The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, 
            as well as in different institutions within countries.
            This outlines the basic types of courses and of teaching and examination methods, 
            with some explanation of their history.</p>
